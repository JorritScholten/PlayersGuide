# Player's Guide Project

Teaching myself Java programming by following the steps in the [player's guide](players_guide_java.md).

**Current task:** [Day 25](/players_guide_java.md#day-25-challenge-the-card-100-xp)

### Why do you think we used a color enumeration here but made a color class in the previous challenge?

Color needed to be an enumeration for the Card class because color also defines a type when it comes to cards.
